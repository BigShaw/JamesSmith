I chose the university because of its many courses and facilities on offer, that are not available in my design degree at AUT. These included photo journalism, future technologies and state of the art editing suites and camera equipment. Over a period of 6 months I learnt alot both academically, technically, and culturally.</p> <td>  <tr> <td class="header">Secondary School - Mt Albert Grammar School <td class="period">2007 - 2011  <tr> <td><p>NCEA levels 2 & 3 achieved with excellence.</p> <td>  <tr> <td><b>Relevant Experience</b>  <tr> <td class="header">Internship at Rawstorne Studio <td class="period">2004  <tr> <td><p>For most of this year I have been doing both paid and volunteer internship work at Rawstorne Studio, a creative design consultancy.
